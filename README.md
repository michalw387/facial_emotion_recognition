# Facial Emotion Recognition

This project aims to recognize emotions based on human facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Network. 

The key components of the project are:

Face Detection: Utilized shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks to identify 68 facial landmarks, enabling precise localization of the face within the image.
Emotion Recognition: Employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to classify emotions based on the input from face image.
Database: Used the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset, which contains recordings of people expressing various emotions.
